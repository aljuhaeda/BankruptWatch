# BankruptWatch: A Machine Learning Approach to Bankruptcy Prediction

BankruptWatch is a project focused on predicting the likelihood of bankruptcy for companies based on the dataset obtained from the **Taiwan Economic Journal** spanning from **1999 to 2009**. The determination of a company's bankruptcy status is influenced by business regulations issued by the **Taiwan Stock Exchange**.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction?datasetId=1111894&sortBy=voteCount). It provides valuable information for training and evaluating the bankruptcy prediction models.

## Machine Learning Techniques

In this project, the focus is on implementing oversampling techniques with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). The primary goal is to address imbalances in the dataset, particularly in the context of predicting bankruptcy where positive cases might be underrepresented.

## Predictive Models

The project includes the comparison of two powerful ensemble learning algorithms:

- **AdaBoost**: An adaptive boosting algorithm that combines weak classifiers to create a strong classifier.

- **Random Forest**: A robust ensemble method that constructs a multitude of decision trees and merges them together.
